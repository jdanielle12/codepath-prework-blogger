Blogger is an app that allows users to create personalized blogs and share pictures, ideas, trips, stories, advice, etc with one another. Your blog can be public or private and users can host more than one blog under the same account.

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
1. Rover
    - Booking with clients 
    - Updating pet statuses (food, water, pee, etc)
    - Calendar availability (being able to block off days and times unavailable or available)
    
2. Lose It!
    - barcode scanner to quickly import nutrition information from your food
    - graph to show weight loss progress
    - food breakdown of fats, proteins, carbs, etc
    
3. Starbucks
    - ordering through the app
    - ability to customize drink orders
    
    
I would like to make a recipe blog/ AI recipe finder. It would include a dashboard called the "Chef Board" and a saved log of all favorited recipes called the "recipe book". I would like it to allow users to input random ingredients that they have at home and generate recipes with those items listed to help people learn to cook better with what they already have. 


## Notes

Aside from trying to understand how Swift works, the only main issue I ran into was getting the button to change colors initially as I forgot to implement that it was an action button.
